== What you will learn

**NOTE: Use this guide only for Kabanero V0.5.0 and earlier releases.**

You will use the Kabanero Eclipse MicroProfile Collection in your Eclipse IDE to create and run a simple cloud native microservice Java application.

Kabanero's Eclipse MicroProfile Collection contains all the components you need to develop your microservice application, including the Eclipse MicroProfile application stack and any necessary container build and deployment artifacts.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

. You must have https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Docker] installed.
. You must install the *Eclipse Codewind Extension* from the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind[Eclipse Marketplace], which creates a *CODEWIND* workspace and downloads Docker images to your Docker registry.
. (Optional) If you have an enterprise-specific Kabanero Collection Hub, you need the URL to your index file.

Everything is now set up, and you're ready to create your first project!

// =================================================================================================
// Getting started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

Kabanero brings together open source technologies that provide a framework for developing cloud native microservice
applications. As a developer, you are likely to have a preferred IDE for writing application
code. In this guide, we are going to develop a simple containerized microservice application that is
based on the Eclipse MicroProfile Kabanero Collection in the Eclipse IDE.

Kabanero contains Appsody, which is designed to enable applications to be built and tested inside a container.
To access Appsody functions from your IDE, you need Eclipse Codewind, a plugin that provides a rich user interface that integrates
seamlessly into the Eclipse IDE. Codewind also provides performance and monitoring tools to help you test and debug applications
in containers.

When you install *Eclipse Codewind*, an extension to Appsody is automatically installed as part of your
*CODEWIND* workspace. By default, Codewind is configured to use the latest Appsody stacks that are
available in the Appsody GitHub repository. However, those stacks are not integrated with Kabanero.
In order to use Appsody with Kabanero you need to configure Codewind to use a Kabanero Collection Hub.

== Configuring your environment to use a Kabanero Collection Hub

As a developer, your enterprise architect might provide you with the URL of a Kabanero Collection Hub that your
organisation has defined for developers to use. If not, you should clone the *public* Kabanero Collection
Hub locally. The public collection is updated on a regular basis, so by making a copy, you avoid adopting unplanned changes.

To keep things simple in this guide, you will add the latest *public* Kabanero Collection Hub repository instead of a clone of
a Kabanero Collection Hub repository.

With *Codewind* installed, make sure you have it showing in one of the Eclipse side panels. If you cannot see Codewind Explorer,
go to the *Menu Bar* and select *Window* > *Show View* > *Other* > *Codewind Explorer* and press *OK*.

Now we can edit the template sources where Codewind expects to find the Kabanero Collections. Right-click *Projects (Local)* and
select *Manage Template Sources*. A new box appears with a list of template sources, including *Standard Codewind Templates*
and *Appsody Stacks*.

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-add-source.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-add-source.png" alt="Diagram shows popup to add a new Source to Codewind."]

Kabanero Collections might already be showing in this list. If so, enable it with the *tick box*.
If Kabanero Collections are not in the list, select *Add* and enter `Kabanero Collections` as a description. In the URL field,
enter `https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/latest/download/kabanero-index.json`.

*Note*: If you've been provided with a Kabanero Collection Hub URL for your organisation you can repeat the last step to add it.

Uncheck all the other template sources except Kabanero Collections because those sources are not supported by the Kabanero application cluster.

Codewind is now configured to use the *public* Kabanero Collection Hub.

== Initializing your project

In the Explorer view, right-click on **Projects** and select **Create New Project** to get a list of available Kabanero Collections.

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-rightclick-project.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-rightclick-project.png" alt="Diagram shows popup to create a new Project."]

From the **Create a new project** window, choose the *Kabanero Eclipse MicroProfile Template*, as shown in the following diagram:

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-create-project.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-create-project.png" alt="Diagram shows popup to create a new Project."]

Choose a suitable name for your project and select *Finish* to save it.

Your new project is created, built, and compiled inside a container. To see the status of the build, right-click the project in *Codewind Explorer*, select *Show Log Files* and chose *Appsody.log*. The log files for the container are shown in a *Console Window*.

When the application is compiled and running on localhost, the status changes from **[Stopped] [Build Successful]** to **[Running] [Build Successful]**. Right-click the project in Codewind Explorer and select *Open Application* to view the app running on your local machine.

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-open-application.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-open-application.png" alt="Diagram shows the open application option."]

*Note*: This process takes longer the first time it runs because dependencies are downloaded and installed.

== Understanding the project layout

Projects are created with a default set of files, which you can find in a Project Explorer in your *CODEWIND-WORKSPACE*.

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-project-explorer.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-project-explorer.png" alt="Diagram shows the Project Explorer view.""]

Show the Application by right-clicking the Project from the Codewind Explorer and selecting **Open Application**.

The Eclipse browser opens to display *"Welcome to your Appsody Microservice"* on `http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/`. Make a note
of the `<local_port_number>` for your next task.

== Creating and updating the application

You are now going to create a new route that listens on `http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/starter/hello`.

In *Project Explorer*, right click on the `dev.appsody.starter` package located inside the `Java Resources` > `src/main/java` folder and create a new file called `HelloResource`.

Add the following code to this new file:

```
package dev.appsody.starter;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;


@Path("/")
public class HelloResource {
    @GET
    @Path("hello")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

Save the changes.

Codewind watches for file changes and automatically recompiles your application. Point your browser to
`http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/starter/hello` to see your new route, which displays **Hello World!**.

This code is creating a new path on `/hello` to return a String to the browser saying *Hello World!*. The starter part of the full URL comes from the `StarterApplication.java` file, which specifies that all routes should begin with `/starter`.

== Testing and debugging the application

You can perform a number of operations through the Eclipse Explorer interface
that help you develop, test, and debug your application locally. Right-click on your project to see a
list of available tasks:

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-rightclick-options.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-rightclick-options.png" alt="Diagram shows the right click options"]

- you can disable the automated build of your project and build it on demand
- you can restart your application in run mode or debug mode
- you can view the available logs to troubleshoot issues
- you can find information about the running app in **Open Project Overview**. Eclipse displays information about your project, including the location, status, and any ports in use. The output is similar to the
following screenshot:

image::/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-project-overview.png[link="/img/guide/microprofile-eclipse-codewind-project-overview.png" alt="Diagram shows the Project Overview page."]

- you can stop the application, by clicking the *Disable project* button.

At some stage in development, you might want to do some local
performance testing. As well as checking whether your code runs cleanly, Codewind
provides application metrics and performance monitoring. For more information about
developing applications with Eclipse Codewind, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsegettingstarted.html[Codewind
documentation].

When you’ve finished unit testing your microservice application on your local system, the next stage in the
process is to test the microservice in the context of the overall system. To test the application as part of
the system, you must deploy the system and then the new application, which requires access to a Kubernetes or Knative environment.


// =================================================================================================
// Deploying your application
// =================================================================================================

== Deploying your application

If your responsibilities include deploying your microservice application on Kubernetes or Knative, additional pre-requisites apply.
For example, you must install the Appsody CLI and configure Kubernetes on your local system. The steps required to
deploy an application to Kubernetes or Knative are covered in
https://kabanero.io/guides/collection-microprofile/[Developing cloud native microservices with the Eclipse MicroProfile Collection and Appsody CLI].

If deploying your microservice application as part of the overall system is handled by another team in your organisation,
your role in the deployment process ends by delivering your changes to a GitHub repository. Here, your operations team can
automate the deployment of your microservice application to a kubernetes or Knative test environment by implementing Tekton
webhooks that trigger Tekton pipelines.
